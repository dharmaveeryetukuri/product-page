Hello there!, 

here are the instructions for running code

1. i have used VS code editer for code and also used Node.js for running npm commands, 
	==> for running the code download the file into your local computer and open it in your code editer.
	==> open the located file folder and open the file.
	==> then open the terminal in your code editor and run the command " npm start" then it will open in your respective browser.
2. Structure of the file is similer to every Reactjs file structure but src folder i have added required components for this project such as Cart, Maincomponents (this is the main card for all the content). Again in Maincomponent i have another components structure ProductAdd(for increment or decrement product quantity), Products(this component for all the produt details in the page), Rating (this component is for rating the product), Timer (for countdown timer but unfortunatly it couldn't work). In the App.js file i have included the Maincomponent so that the code function as designed. Every component have their respective ".js and .css" file. 

3. Technologies that i have used for this project are 
	==> Reactjs as main front end technology for better User interface and experience and easy to understand and re-usable components.
	==> for style i have used CSS.
	==> for image and icons intigration i have used bootstrap.
	==> also used materialUI for some components.
